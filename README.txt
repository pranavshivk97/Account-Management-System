==Account Management System==

This program simulates an account management system, which keeps track of the number of stocks owned as well as the account balance of the 
user. 
  
The stock portfolio is basically a system which uses doubly linked lists to keep track of the number of stocks owned by the user. The user 
has the option to view the price of a stock or buy/sell stocks, determined by the availability and account balance of the user. The bank 
account allows the user to view his balance and deposit/withdraw money into his account. These are two public derived classes from the base
class Account.
